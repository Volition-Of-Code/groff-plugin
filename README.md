## About

In many modern day IDEs there exist a plethora of available plugins for a wide variety of purposes; however, a commonly utilized utility in the realm of Linux has no appropriate plugin: [_GROFF_](https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/groff.html).  _GROFF_ is occasionally used for formal publications and general purpose typesetting system.  Its largest usage is in the macro package _man_.  All _man_ pages use GROFF as the underlying typesetting system producing the familar output in the terminal window.  Documentation is important and writing _man_ pages is helpful for general purpose program usage/troubleshooting.

## Example Usage

\<TO BE FILLED IN\>

## Purpose

As noted in **About**, few plugins exist to support _GROFF_ syntax highlighting and autocompletion.  This is not a revolutionary idea nor is it bringing about world peace; however, this could introduce those unfamilar with _GROFF_ or _man_ page writing with an easier starting point.

## Usage

Simply install the plugin in the respective IDE of choice and begin editing _GROFF_ associated files.
